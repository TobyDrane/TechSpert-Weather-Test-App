# TechSpert-Weather-Test-App
Angular weather test app for TechSpert coding interview

The project was bootstrapped with Angular CLI and only has ng2-charts as a dependancy. First time coding a project in Angular (I come from React) so hoping the use of Pipes and Observables was correct.

Unit testing could be expanded to including the pipes within the table component as I currently only just test the pipe directly.

All code was my own.
